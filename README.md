# SimECosmo
SIMECOSMO is an acronym in Portuguese for "Cosmology Teaching Simulator".

Its objective is to graphically show how cosmological parameters affect theoretical predictions for a given cosmological model and these values affect statistical results.

This program was developed in python 3.8 using the graphical interface with the Tkinter user.

Its source code will be made available for public development in the future. For now, I present here your executable version with .exe extension of SimECosmo.

Any suggestion or problem in the program please contact us.

The code can be acessed for here:
